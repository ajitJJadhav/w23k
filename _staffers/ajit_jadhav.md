Hi everyone! Welcome to CS8! A bit about me - I am a second-year master's student in the CS department. I completed my Bachelor's in CS in 2020. I have experience developing AI systems primarily using Python. Some of the projects I have worked on include developing backend systems for AI-based chatbot automation systems and also, system for monitoring errors in automated ML training pipelines. 

I would love to help students learn to code and work on interesting projects. Hope you guys have a great time learning with this course!
